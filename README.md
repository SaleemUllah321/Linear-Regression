Linear Regression
This repository contains a simple implementation of Linear Regression in Python. Linear Regression is a statistical method that is used to establish a relationship between a dependent variable (Y) and one or more independent variables (X). The implementation in this repository is a simple one and is meant to be used as a learning tool.

Installation
To use this implementation of Linear Regression, clone the repository to your local machine using:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/SaleemUllah321/Linear-Regression.git
Usage
The implementation in this repository can be used to fit a linear regression model on a given dataset. To use the implementation, follow these steps:

Import the LinearRegression class from the linear_regression.py file:

python
Copy code
from linear_regression import LinearRegression
Create an instance of the LinearRegression class:

python
Copy code
lr = LinearRegression()
Fit the linear regression model on your dataset:

python
Copy code
lr.fit(X, y)
Here, X is a 2D numpy array containing the independent variables and y is a 1D numpy array containing the dependent variable.

Predict the values of the dependent variable using the fitted model:

python
Copy code
y_pred = lr.predict(X)
Here, X is a 2D numpy array containing the independent variables.

Example
Here's an example of how to use the implementation:

python
Copy code
import numpy as np
from linear_regression import LinearRegression

# create some random data
X = np.random.rand(100, 3)
y = np.dot(X, np.array([1.5, 2.5, 3.5])) + 0.5

# create an instance of the LinearRegression class
lr = LinearRegression()

# fit the linear regression model on the data
lr.fit(X, y)

# predict the values of the dependent variable
y_pred = lr.predict(X)

# print the coefficients of the linear regression model
print(lr.coef_)
